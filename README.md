# Learn_MonkeyJump
We integrated a custom Gym environment for reinforcement learning with a monkey-themed game, ensured compatibility with Stable-Baselines3, and provided a setup to play and train the game using Python.
 
Install Stable-Baselines3: `python3.11 -m pip install stable-baselines3`

Either train the game `python3.11 train_OpenGym.py`
Or play it: `python3.11 main.py`

The original game is on the [MonkeyJump](https://github.com/MartinezAgullo/MonkeyJump/tree/main) repository
